A5 Team project
===================

Purpose of Project
----------------------
In Ashesi, the internet speed is often slow because a lot of people download large files particularly movies. Usually, people end up downloading the same videos or files that have already been downloaded by their colleagues. Instead of having everybody downloading videos all the time, it would be nice to have a platform where people can check to see if other people have copies of files that they want.And the purpose of the project is to provide this platform.

Scenario
----------------------
1. Eliza needs to download a tutorial for the software engineering class. She has tried to download the video several times    but the internet on campus is not stable. Anytime she tries to download the videos, her room-mates suffer as the           internet speed worsens. She does not want to go round asking people if they have the video too.

Payoff Scenario 
----------------------
1. Eliza is a student of Ashesi who wants a copy of angular-js-in-20ish-minutes video tutorial. Before downloading the        video from youtube, she checks the Data Saver app and finds that three other people have the tutorial. She borrows a pen    drive and contacts one of the students for a tutorial. She is pleased that she did not have to wait for the tutorial to    download which could take about fifteen minutes. (It took her just 3 minutes ;contacting the colleague and copying the     file onto the pen drive) .She did not slow down the internet speed in her room and she did not consume any more of the     internet bandwidth.
   

   Payoff
   -------------
   1.	Time spent on downloading videos is shortened (The video can be copied directly using a pen drive)
   2.	The speed of the internet becomes faster
   3.	The bandwidth is saved
