* **Customer:** Michael is a 21 year old second year student who learns a lot from watching videos and has fun watching movies too
* **Context:** Michael always feels the need to download videos to facilitate learning and also get the latest videos.
* **Problem:** The internet in Ashesi can be very slow. Sometimes too, the firewall blocks certain sites that offer educational videos.
* **Payoff:** Michael can find out the videos that other students have that he wants. He can then contact the students and copy the files on a pendrive, tablet or other storage device
