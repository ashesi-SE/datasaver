### Interviews
We used the same persona as last week’s iteration.
We interviewed four people.
We told them our plan for this project, what it will solve and how it’s will work. They were excited and couldn’t wait to use it. This was where we got feedback on user signup and login

### Persona 1

* Tasha loves music, movies and is mostly concerned about how internet in school is usually limited and therefore is not able to download assignment files, tutorial videos and movies for relaxation. She is time conscious and doesn’t like to go round asking her colleagues if they have copies of a given assignment or a new movie she wants to watch.

### Persona 2
* Name: Michael Aboagye
* Occupation: Sophomore student of Ashesi University
* Age: 20

* Michael is a second year student in Ashesi. He is a visual learner who likes to watch tutorials in addition to the lectures he takes in class. He loves to watch movies and play the latest games. He keeps the movies that he watches.
